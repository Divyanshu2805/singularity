 * gateway-service's entry point: the single origin the browser talks to.

 * <p>Handles: starting the Spring Cloud Gateway. It is reactive and non-blocking, which is what lets it pass an SSE
 * stream through without buffering it.
 *
 * <p>The Gateway carries no authentication logic of its own - it is a transparent passthrough with an ordered route
 * table that sends each URL to the service that owns it, configured in application.yaml. Route order is load-bearing,
 * and there is no catch-all: a path nothing owns is a 404 from here.
