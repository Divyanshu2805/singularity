# Fails (non-zero) when the newest complete backup in R2 is older than MAX_AGE_HOURS, or when there is none at all.
# This is the alarm for deploy/k8s/base/backup.yaml: a CronJob that fails does so silently - nothing emails anyone
# when a pod errors at 02:30 - so a backup that has quietly stopped working would otherwise be discovered on the
# day the data is needed. Run daily by .github/workflows/uptime.yml, where a failed run is what sends the email.
#
# It reads the `LATEST` object the backup job writes as its very last step, and only after every dump and mirror
# succeeded, so a night whose upload half-finished leaves LATEST at the previous good night and this check goes red
# after MAX_AGE_HOURS instead of trusting a partial backup. The default of 30 hours is one nightly period plus slack
# for a slow run or a delayed start; the CronJob's own `startingDeadlineSeconds` is 2 hours.
#
# Uses `curl --aws-sigv4` (curl >= 7.75, present on the GitHub runners) rather than an AWS CLI, so there is nothing
# to install and it runs the same on a laptop. Expects, as env vars:
#   R2_ENDPOINT, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY      (the same three the GitHub `production` environment holds)
# and optionally:
#   R2_BUCKET         default singularity-backups
#   R2_REGION         default `auto`, which is what R2 wants; a MinIO used as a stand-in wants `us-east-1`
#   MAX_AGE_HOURS     default 30
