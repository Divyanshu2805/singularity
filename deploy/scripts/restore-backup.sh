# Restores the app's data from one of deploy/k8s/base/backup.yaml's nightly backups: Postgres (all three service
# databases) and every MinIO bucket, replacing whatever is there now.
#
#   deploy/scripts/restore-backup.sh --context <kube-context> [--date YYYY-MM-DD|latest] --yes
#
# DESTRUCTIVE: everything written after the chosen backup is lost. Two deliberate speed bumps against restoring the
# wrong cluster - the kube context must be named explicitly (this script never falls back to the current context,
# so a `kubectl` left pointed at production after an afternoon on kind cannot be hit by accident), and it prints the
# API server it is about to act on before doing anything. `--yes` is required; without it the script only says what
# it would do.
#
# What it does: (1) scales account/workspace/intelligence to zero, so nothing is writing to a database that is about
# to be swapped; (2) renders restore-job.yaml.tmpl and runs it to completion; (3) scales the three services back to
# the replica counts they had. If the Job fails it does NOT scale them back up - bringing services up over a
# half-restored database is worse than an outage - and instead prints exactly what to do.
#
# Needs: kubectl, and the `r2-backup-credentials` Secret in the target cluster (apply-secrets.sh creates it on every
# deploy; on a fresh cluster run that first). Everything else it uses - the images, the credentials - it takes from
# the cluster's own nightly-backup CronJob and Secrets, so nothing here can drift from the backup job.
