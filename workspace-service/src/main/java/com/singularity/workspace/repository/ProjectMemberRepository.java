 * behind every permission check - counting the projects a user owns for the plan's project quota, and serializing a
 * user's own concurrent quota checks so two requests can't both be admitted at the last slot.

 * <p>Both queries that answer a question about entitlement exclude soft-deleted projects. Without that, a deleted
