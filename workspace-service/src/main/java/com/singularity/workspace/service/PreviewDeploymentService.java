/**
 * Live previews: a project's files running in a Vite dev server, reachable at a URL of their own.
 *
 * <p>Handles: opening a project's preview for the caller - joining the runner a collaborator already has going, or
 * starting one - reading it, restarting the dev server in place, closing the caller's own session, reading the
 * runner's output, listing the caller's open previews, counting them for the plan allowance, ending one specific
 * member's session when they are removed from the project, and stopping every preview of a project when the project
 * itself is deleted.
 *
 * <p>Starting returns while the preview is still coming up; the caller polls. The shared runner stops only once
 * nobody has it open.
