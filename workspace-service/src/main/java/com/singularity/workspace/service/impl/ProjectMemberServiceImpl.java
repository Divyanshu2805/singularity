/**
 * A project's collaborators.
 *
 * <p>Handles: listing members with their names resolved from account-service, inviting one by email, accepting an
 * invitation, changing a role and removing a member.
 *
 * <p>It enforces the single-owner invariant: owner cannot be granted by invitation or by a role change, the owner's
 * own role cannot be changed, and the owner cannot be removed - deleting the project is the way to end it. Without
 * those checks a project could end up with two owners or none.
 *
 * <p>Listing makes one lookup per member because account-service has no batch user endpoint today. That is fine for
 * the membership sizes this feature actually has.
 *
 * <p>Removal also revokes standing, not just the row: it best-effort asks intelligence-service to stop that member's
 * in-flight generation and ends their open preview session, so losing access takes effect immediately rather than
 * only once whatever they were doing happens to finish.
