 * renaming, deleting, forking, retrying starter-template initialisation, and the per-member pin and star flags.
 *
 * <p>Deleting means different things to different people: the owner deletes the project for everyone, while an editor
 * only removes their own membership and the project carries on unchanged for everybody else. Forking copies every
 * file into a new project the caller owns - not the chat, notes or members - and the two are independent from then
