/**
 * The one definition of what a project file path may be, and the canonical form every read and write uses.
 *
 * <p>Handles: normalising a path to its stored form - Unicode NFC, no leading slash, forward slashes only - and
 * rejecting anything that is not a plain relative path inside the project: blank, absolute, over-long, containing a
 * backslash, a control or bidirectional-override character, an empty segment, or a . or .. segment. The object key is
 * derived here too, so reads and writes cannot disagree about the same file.
 *
 * <p>Validation is a boundary, not a formality. Paths arrive from the model's file protocol and from callers, and a
 * stored path is later used verbatim in places that do resolve .. - the entry name in a downloaded ZIP, and the
 * destination of the mirror that copies a project into its preview pod. A traversing path would escape the project
 * there even though object storage itself treats the key as opaque. Rejecting it on the way in is what keeps every
 * one of those consumers safe.
 *
 * <p>NFC normalisation happens before anything else so two byte-different spellings of one visual path - the model
 * emitting a combining-character form where a caller typed the precomposed one, or vice versa - collapse to the same
 * stored path instead of silently creating two files that look identical in the tree. Rejecting Unicode format
 * characters (category Cf: right-to-left/left-to-right overrides, zero-width joiners, byte-order marks) closes the
 * classic filename-spoofing trick of making an extension read as something else, which plain ASCII control-character
 * rejection does not catch.
