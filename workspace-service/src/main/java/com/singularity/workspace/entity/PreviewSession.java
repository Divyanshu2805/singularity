/**
 * One person's use of a project's preview.
 *
 * <p>Handles: who has it open on which project, their own idle clock, and how and when their session ended -
 * including whether it ended because the runner failed.
 *
 * <p>The distinction it exists for: a preview row is the runner, one per project and shared, because collaborators
 * work on the same files and a second runner would only be a stale copy. A session is what makes it theirs - a
 * preview shows as running for someone only while they have a session open, their Stop ends only their session, and
 * their plan's allowance counts only their sessions. The runner shuts down once no session is left on it. Without
 * sessions, one collaborator starting a preview made it appear running for everyone, and any of them pressing Stop
 * took it away from the others.
