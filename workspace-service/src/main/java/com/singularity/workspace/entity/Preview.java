/**
 * One attempt at running a project live: a runner pod claimed from the pool, the project's files synced into it, and
 * a Vite dev server behind the preview proxy.
 *
 * <p>Handles: which pod and namespace it runs in, the hostname and URL it is served on, who started it, its status
 * and the step or failure reason behind that, the tail of the output when a start fails, the lifecycle timestamps
 * including the last time anyone looked at it, and which service instance's bootstrap owns it and when that
 * bootstrap last proved it was still alive - CODE_REVIEW.md PRE-03, so a rolling deployment's new instance can tell
 * a still-running bootstrap apart from one truly abandoned by a crashed process.
 *
 * <p>A new row per start, so a failure stays readable after a retry. The hostname is reused by every later preview of
 * the same project, so a shared link keeps working across stops and restarts, and is random so it cannot be guessed
 * from the project id.
 *
 * <p>Status moves only through the repository's conditional updates, never by saving a loaded entity: the
 * asynchronous bootstrap and a user pressing Stop race, and a plain save from whichever finished last would bring a
 * stopped preview back to life. The projectId column is a read-only duplicate of the relation, for code running
 * outside a request - the reaper - where touching the lazy relation would throw.
