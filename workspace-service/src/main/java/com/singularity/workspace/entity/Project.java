 * outstanding starter-template problem, and the project it was forked from.
 *
 * <p>Soft deletion is a plain column with no automatic filter, so every query that must exclude deleted projects has
 * to say so itself. The fork reference is a plain id rather than a relation: a fork is its own project from the
 * moment it is made and must keep working if the original is later deleted.
