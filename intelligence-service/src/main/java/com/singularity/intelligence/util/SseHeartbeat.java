/**
 * Keeps a streaming HTTP response alive by interleaving SSE comment lines into an otherwise-idle stream.
 *
 * <p>Handles: an AI turn can go tens of seconds between tokens while the model "thinks" - long enough that
 * Cloudflare's own idle-connection timeout (100s with no bytes sent) would sever the tunnel mid-generation, handing
 * the browser a 524 with no way to tell a real failure from an active model still working. An SSE comment
 * ({@code : keep-alive}) carries no {@code event:}/{@code data:} field, so it's invisible to EventSource's own
 * parsing - ignored by anything listening for a named or default event - but its bytes reset every idle-timeout
 * clock sitting between here and the browser.
 *
 * <p>Built on {@link Flux#publish(java.util.function.Function)} specifically so the source is subscribed to exactly
 * once: the heartbeat's own stop condition ({@code shared.then()}) observes the SAME subscription the caller's data
 * is forwarded from, rather than opening a second one. A source backed by a live AI generation must never be
 * subscribed to twice - a second subscription would mean starting, and billing, that generation again.
