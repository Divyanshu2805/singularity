 * One AI call's usage, on its way to being recorded.

 *
 * <p>The user id is always explicit. Two call sites once lost usage by reading the caller from the security context
 * at completion time: a stream's completion runs off the request thread, where there is no signed-in user, so the
 * write failed and was swallowed. Capture the id on the request thread, then pass it.
