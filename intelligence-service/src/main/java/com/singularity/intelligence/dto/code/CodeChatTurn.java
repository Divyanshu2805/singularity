 * One earlier turn of a code conversation, replayed by the client on each request.

 * <p>Handles: the role and the text. The thread is deliberately never stored server-side, so the client is the only
 * place it lives.
 *
 * <p>The role is validated by value rather than trusted: it goes straight into the model's message list, and a client
 * sending "system" could otherwise smuggle in instructions. Any new endpoint that replays client-supplied history
 * needs the same by-value check, not just a length cap.
