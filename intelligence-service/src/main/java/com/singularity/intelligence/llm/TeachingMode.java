/**
 * Whether a generation should explain itself as it builds, and what this learner has already been taught.
 *
 * <p>Handles: the per-request toggle and the concept list read back from the learner's earlier lessons, so the model
 * can use those names without explaining the basics for the twentieth time.
 *
 * <p>The concept strings were written by the model on an earlier turn and go back into a system prompt, so they are
 * flattened to one line, stripped of control characters and quoting, length-capped and deduplicated
 * case-insensitively rather than trusted as they are. The list is capped so it cannot crowd out the rest of the
 * prompt. Nothing about the toggle is stored server-side.
