/**
 * The one tool the model is given: reading files it can see in the file tree.
 *
 * <p>Handles: resolving each requested path, returning its content wrapped in markers the model can read, bounding
 * how many files one call may ask for, and notifying the caller that a read happened - which is how the code lens
 * knows to drop the line the model said just before it.
 *
 * <p>A file that genuinely does not exist and a file that could not be read are reported differently on purpose.
 * Telling the model a file is absent when it is merely unreadable makes it recreate the file, losing whatever was in
 * it.
 *
 * <p>This is typed against the read-only file reader, not the write-capable workspace client, so a future edit that
 * tried to add a write here fails to compile.
 *
 * <p>Two guards bound a single turn's cost, both discovered from a production turn that made 21 {@code read_files}
 * calls re-reading the same two files roughly every 10 seconds and never wrote a fix - 875k tokens for a no-op,
 * because a growing conversation (every earlier tool result included) is resent to the model on every round. A path
 * already returned in full this turn is answered with a short pointer back to it instead of its content again,
 * since the model still has it a few messages up - this is what actually stops the resend from compounding, rather
 * than merely preventing new duplicate content from being added. Once {@link #MAX_CALLS} calls have been made without
 * a written change, every further read is refused with an instruction to answer with what's already in hand, so a
 * turn that is not converging fails fast instead of quietly burning the daily budget. Both counters are per-instance,
 * and a fresh instance is built per generation call ({@code AiGenerationServiceImpl}), so neither leaks across turns.
