/**
 * Bills an AI call to a user's usage - the daily counter quotas read, and the ledger insights read.
 *
 * <p>Handles: pulling the token counts off a model response and writing them, in two forms - a direct, un-reserved
 * record, and reconciling a {@link UsageReservation} claimed by {@code UsageService.reserveBudget} before the call
 * started, either to its real cost or, on {@code release}, back to nothing for a call that produced no chargeable
 * output.
 *
 * <p>Which form matters. The one that reads the caller from the security context is only correct on a request thread;
 * anything recording from a stream's completion - a continuation with no signed-in user - must capture the user id on
 * the request thread first and pass it in. The code lens once used the context-reading form from a stream completion:
 * the lookup threw, this class swallowed it, and those tokens were never billed. A reservation already carries its
 * user id for exactly this reason, so every reconcile/release call is safe off the request thread.
 *
 * <p>Never throws: failing to write a usage row must not fail the user's request.
