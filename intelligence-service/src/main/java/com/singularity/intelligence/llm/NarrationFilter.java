/**
 * Drops what a model says before it reads files, so a streamed answer starts with the answer.
 *
 * <p>Handles: holding back the start of each round, discarding it when a tool call follows (which means it was an
 * announcement), and releasing it once enough text has arrived or the stream has ended (which means it was the
 * answer).
 *
 * <p>With tools enabled the model often announces a lookup, calls the read tool, then answers. The announcement is
 * streamed straight through and the tool-call chunk never is, so the stream carries no marker of where the
 * announcement ends - it simply runs into the answer. The tool being invoked is the one reliable boundary.
 *
 * <p>The cost is that an answer's first few hundred characters appear together instead of trickling in, and narration
 * longer than that is not caught - the prompt is the defence there.
