/**
 * Explains a selected block of code, and answers follow-up questions about it.
 *
 * <p>Handles: the explain and ask answers, whole and streamed, and the caller's saved notes - reading, saving,
 * deleting one and clearing them.
 *
 * <p>Read-only by construction: the answering methods are given exactly one tool, reading files, and their prompts
 * never mention the file-writing protocol - so they can produce text and nothing else. The note methods write, but
 * only to the caller's own notes.
 *
 * <p>Private to the caller: a note belongs to one project and one user, and every note method resolves the user from
 * the session rather than taking one, so two members of a shared project never see each other's notes. It sits
 * alongside teaching mode - that explains code as it is written, this explains code that is already there, on demand.
