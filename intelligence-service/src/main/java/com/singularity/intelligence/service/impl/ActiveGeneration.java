/**
 * One AI response being generated, owned by the server rather than by whichever browser asked for it.
 *
 * <p>Handles: accumulating the model's output, fanning each chunk out to every attached viewer, replaying everything
 * written so far to a viewer that attaches late, ending every viewer's stream on completion or failure, and stopping
 * the underlying model call.
 *
 * <p>It used to be the other way round: the model call was the HTTP response's own stream, so a refresh closed the
 * connection, the stream was cancelled, the model call went with it, and the turn - which is only saved on completion
 * - was never stored at all. Now the generation runs to the end regardless and a connection is just a viewer, so a
 * refreshed page or a second tab picks up exactly where the response is.
 *
 * <p>Every mutation and every new viewer goes through this object's monitor, which is what guarantees a viewer sees
 * each chunk exactly once - replayed if it arrived before they attached, live if after, never both or neither.
 *
 * <p>Also carries the usage reservation claimed before this generation started, and the text accumulated so far, so a
 * stop or a mid-stream provider error - both of which end this outside the model stream's own completion/error
 * signal - can still reconcile that reservation to an estimate of what was actually produced, rather than losing the
 * charge entirely or leaving it stuck at the full reservation forever.
