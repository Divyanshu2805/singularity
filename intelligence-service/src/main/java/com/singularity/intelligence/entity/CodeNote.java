/**
 * One exchange of a project's code notes - a question and the answer it got - belonging to whoever asked it.
 *
 * <p>Handles: the question and answer, and the selected block they were about, stored flat as the file, the code and
 * its line range.
 *
 * <p>Private to its author: the row carries both the project and the user, and every query filters on both, so two
 * people looking at the same project keep separate threads. An exchange rather than a message per row, because the
 * transcript is always a question followed by its answer and deleting one note should take the pair away together
 * rather than leave an answer with no question.
 *
 * <p>The project and user are plain columns, not relations: they live in other services' databases.
