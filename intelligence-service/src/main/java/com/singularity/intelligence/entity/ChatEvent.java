/**
 * One step of an assistant turn: a thought, a message, a checklist item, a file written or deleted, a lesson, or a
 * tool log.
 *
 * <p>Handles: its type and order within the turn, its content, the file it concerns, any metadata (a lesson's concept
 * name, a tool's arguments), and for a file edit the version that file had immediately before this turn saved over
 * it and the lesson teaching mode wrote about that change.
 *
 * <p>The previous version is stored because object storage keeps only a file's current version: without it, the last
 * turn's diff lived only in the browser and was gone after signing out. It is also what a lesson is written from: a
 * lesson explains what the step changed, which is the difference between the two versions.
 *
 * <p>The lesson is written once, the first time the step is opened in a turn that was asked for in teaching mode,
 * and kept here so it stays in the conversation and is never paid for twice.
 *
 * <p>The type column is declared with an explicit column definition so Hibernate does not generate a check constraint
 * listing today's enum values. Such a constraint is created once and never widened, so adding an event type left
 * every insert of the new value failing - and because a turn's events are saved as one batch, a single rejected row
 * took the whole conversation with it while the generated files had already been written.
