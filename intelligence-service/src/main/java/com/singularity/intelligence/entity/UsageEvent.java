/**
 * One AI call's token usage - the ledger behind usage insights.
 *
 * <p>Handles: who made the call, which project it was for (null for calls made before a project exists), what it was
 * for, the token split and when it happened.
 *
 * <p>Why this exists next to the daily counter: that counter is one integer per user per day, which is exactly what
 * quota enforcement wants - a single-row read on every AI request - but it cannot say which project or feature the
 * tokens went to. Both are written together in one transaction; the counter stays the source of truth for limits,
 * this for insight.
 *
 * <p>The feature is stored as a plain string on purpose. Hibernate generates a check constraint for an enum column
 * and never revisits it, so adding a feature later would make every insert of it fail; neither an explicit column
 * definition nor an attribute converter avoids that here, and a string field is the only mapping that does. The
 * timestamp is set explicitly by the writer rather than generated, so a row can carry the time the call actually
 * happened.
