 * file deleted (how a rename gets rid of the old copy), a teaching-mode lesson, a tool log, and a question put to the
 * user when a request cannot be built correctly without their answer.
 *
 * <p>The column these are stored in carries no check constraint, so adding a value here needs no migration - see the
