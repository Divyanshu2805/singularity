/**
 * The outcome of a revision publish, as it crosses workspace-service's internal API.
 *
 * <p>Handles: telling the caller whether every changed path actually landed (APPLIED), or none of them did (FAILED -
 * a storage/validation problem, safe to retry; CONFLICT - the caller's {@code expectedParentRevisionId} was stale,
 * safe to retry after re-reading {@code currentRevisionId}). Publishing is all-or-nothing, so {@code failedPaths} is
 * either empty or the full set of changed paths - there is no partial-success case. {@code previousContent} carries
 * every changed path's content immediately before this call, replacing what used to be a separate pre-write read per
 * file.
