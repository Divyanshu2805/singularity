# The backend now does this itself while it runs (PreviewPortForwarder, preview.port-forward in application.yaml).
# This script is only for when that is disabled, or to reach previews without the backend running.
#
# Makes the local kind cluster's preview pieces reachable from this machine, for as long as this window stays open:
#   http://<anything>.localhost:8090  -> the preview proxy  (what the browser loads)
#   localhost:6379                    -> Redis               (where the backend writes preview routes)
# kind has no load balancer and no host port mappings, so without this the backend can't publish a route and the
# browser can't reach one. Each forward is restarted if it drops (it does whenever the target pod restarts).
#
# Usage:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File k8s\dev-port-forward.ps1
