/**
 * A session cookie someone signed out of.
 *
 * <p>Handles: the SHA-256 of that cookie and when it would have expired anyway, after which the row is dead weight
 * and gets pruned.
 *
 * <p>This table exists because Firebase can only revoke all of a user's sessions at once. Signing out of one device
 * is enforced here instead: the cookie stays cryptographically valid until it expires, and this row is what makes it
 * useless before then. Only the hash is stored, never the cookie.
