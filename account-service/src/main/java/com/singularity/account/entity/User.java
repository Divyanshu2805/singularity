/**
 * An account on this platform.
 *
 * <p>Handles: the email used as the username, the display name, the Firebase uid, the Stripe customer id once they
 * have one, and a nullable deletedAt for soft deletion.
 *
 * <p>The Firebase uid is the identity every sign-in method resolves to, and accounts are matched on it rather than on
 * email: an address can change hands, the uid cannot. Soft deletion is a plain column with no automatic filter, so
 * every query that must exclude deleted users has to say so itself. There is no password column - Firebase is the
 * only sign-in method.
