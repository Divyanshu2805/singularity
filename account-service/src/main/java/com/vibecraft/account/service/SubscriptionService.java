/**
 * What a user is entitled to, and the subscription state behind it.
 *
 * <p>Handles: reading the caller's current subscription (never null-plan - someone who has never paid gets the free
 * plan back), resolving the plan a user is entitled to right now, and the state transitions the Stripe webhooks
 * drive: activation, update, cancellation, renewal and past-due. It also holds the free-tier constants, which
 * PlanSeeder writes into the free plan row so enforcement and the pricing page cannot disagree.
 *
 * <p>Counting owned projects is deliberately not here: that is workspace-service's table. This service only ever
 * answers what a plan allows, and the caller does its own counting.
 *
 * <p>Every state-changing method takes an {@code eventTime}: the Stripe webhook's own event-creation timestamp, or
 * {@code null} for a caller that isn't racing other events (a fresh live re-read from Stripe, or the row's own
 * creation). It is compared against the row's last-applied event time so a delayed or redelivered-out-of-order
 * webhook cannot overwrite newer state with older state - see SubscriptionServiceImpl's class Javadoc.
