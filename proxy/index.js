/**
 * The preview proxy: routes every preview hostname to the runner pod serving it, to whoever presents a valid access
 * token for that hostname.
 *
 * Handles: looking a hostname's route up in Redis, verifying the signed access token workspace-service appended to
 * the preview URL (CODE_REVIEW.md SEC-06) before proxying either HTTP or websockets to that pod, recording that a
 * preview was visited, rewriting a page load's HTML on the way out to inject the reporter (reporter.js), and serving
 * a readable page when there is no route, no valid token, or the runner does not answer.
 *
 * Without the token check, a preview's hostname alone is a permanent, unauthenticated bearer link: this proxy has no
 * concept of project membership, so anyone who ever saw the URL - including a member later removed from the project
 * - kept working access forever. verifyToken re-implements PreviewAccessToken.java's exact HMAC-SHA256 scheme so
 * this stays a fully stateless check with no database or session store of its own; the two must stay byte-for-byte
 * identical (see PreviewAccessTokenTest's cross-language contract test) or every link starts failing.
 *
 * The token arrives once, as a query parameter, on the first page load; a valid one is exchanged for a cookie
 * (`SameSite=None` because previews are shown in a cross-site iframe from the main app, which browsers otherwise
 * refuse to attach a cookie to) and the URL is redirected to drop the token from the address bar, browser history
 * and any outbound Referer. Every later request - including the websocket upgrade - is authorized by that cookie
 * alone, re-verified statelessly on every single request rather than looked up anywhere, so the token's own expiry
 * (`preview.access-token-ttl`) is what actually bounds how long a removed member's already-open tab keeps working:
 * there is nothing to push a revocation to.
 *
 * The backend writes the route key once a preview's dev server answers and removes it when the preview stops; this
 * writes the last-seen key as pages load, which is how the backend's idle reaper knows a preview open in its own tab
 * is still in use. Keep both key names in step with the backend's router - nothing else ties the two together.
 *
 * Redis waits are bounded on purpose (CODE_REVIEW.md PRE-08): an unlimited command queue turns an outage into
 * requests that hang forever rather than failing, and the last-seen map is swept so a long-lived process cannot
 * accumulate one entry per hostname it has ever served. A Redis error and a genuinely missing route are told apart
 * (routing.js's ROUTER_UNAVAILABLE) so an outage shows "try again" rather than "this preview isn't running" - the
 * latter is what a visitor sees when their own preview was never started, which a Redis hiccup is not. Waiting on
 * the runner pod itself is bounded too: a pod at "Running" whose dev server has died or wedged (PRE-06) must fail a
 * request the same way an unreachable one does, not hang until the client gives up - proxyTimeout covers the plain
 * HTTP passes, and the manual proxyReqWs timer covers the websocket pass, which http-proxy never times out itself.
 *
 * The HTML rewrite asks for an uncompressed response, since it has to read the body - the dev server does not
 * compress, but a user's own server might. What the injected reporter does inside the page, and what the status
 * pages tell the Preview tab about themselves, is reporter.js's.
 *
 * A page load is never answered from the browser's cache. The dev server sends its HTML with an ETag, the browser
 * asked "has it changed?", the dev server said no, and the browser showed the copy it had - with the reporter that
 * was injected into that copy, however long ago. After the reporter gained back, forward and the address bar, a
 * preview on a hostname the browser had seen before went on running the old one: the address showed, the buttons
 * stayed grey and typing an address did nothing. The conditional headers are taken off the request, so the dev
 * server always sends the page, and the page goes out with no validator and marked not to be stored.
