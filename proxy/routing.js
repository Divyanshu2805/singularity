/**
 * Turns a route lookup's outcome into the page index.js shows a visitor (CODE_REVIEW.md PRE-08), pulled out of

 * Handles: telling apart "no preview has ever registered this hostname" from "Redis itself didn't answer" - the two
 * looked identical before (both a bare null from a try/catch), which told a visitor "this preview isn't running"
 * during a Redis outage that has nothing to do with whether their preview is running at all. ROUTER_UNAVAILABLE is a
 * distinct sentinel index.js's getTarget returns instead of null so this function can tell them apart.
