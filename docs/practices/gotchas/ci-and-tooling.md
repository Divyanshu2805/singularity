# Pitfalls: CI and Tooling

## Tailscale OAuth clients need the `auth_keys` scope

- **Symptom:** the "join the tailnet" step retries a few times with `403: calling actor does not have enough permissions`, then **passes** — and the deploy can't reach the cluster. `tailscale status` reports `Logged out`.
- **Cause:** an OAuth client with only `devices:core` can't mint the auth key a CI node needs; the action retries and exits successfully anyway.
- **Fix:** create the OAuth client with **Auth Keys: Write** and a tag (`tag:ci`). Verify connectivity with a real call (the deploy job retries `kubectl get --raw=/livez`) rather than trusting the step's result.

## A job that doesn't declare its environment sees no variables

- **Symptom:** a deployed frontend says "Firebase sign-in isn't configured", although every `VITE_FIREBASE_*` variable is set in GitHub.
- **Cause:** environment variables and secrets are visible only to jobs that declare `environment: production`. Without it, `vars.*` resolve to empty strings with no error.
- **Fix:** declare the environment on every job that reads its values, including image builds that bake values in.

## New GHCR packages may be private

- **Symptom:** a deploy can't pull a freshly pushed image.
- **Cause:** GitHub Container Registry can create a new package as private even when the repository is public.
- **Fix:** in the package's settings, change its visibility to public (once per image).

## MinIO's own images are no longer public

- **Symptom:** `RevisionPublisherIntegrationTest` fails in CI with `unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized` while pulling MinIO, and a fresh node or kind cluster can't start MinIO or any `mc` container.
- **Cause:** MinIO stopped serving its images anonymously from both `quay.io/minio/*` and Docker Hub's `minio/*`. A node that pulled them earlier keeps working from its cache, which hides the problem until something needs a fresh pull.
- **Fix:** every reference uses this repo's public GHCR mirror, `ghcr.io/divyanshu2805/minio` and `ghcr.io/divyanshu2805/mc`, with the upstream tags and both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. The images are unmodified upstream builds (AGPL-3.0; source at github.com/minio/minio and github.com/minio/mc). To move to a newer MinIO release, build it from that source for both platforms and push it to the mirror first.

## Operator scripts act on the current `kubectl` context

- **Symptom:** a script meant for one cluster changes another.
- **Cause:** `deploy/scripts/apply-secrets.sh` uses whatever context `kubectl` points at and rewrites every Secret.
- **Fix:** always pass `--context` explicitly, keep production and local kubeconfigs separate, and test such scripts with a stand-in `kubectl` on the `PATH` and `KUBECONFIG` pointing at a file that doesn't exist. `restore-backup.sh` refuses to run without an explicit `--context`.

## Git Bash rewrites leading slashes

- **Symptom:** `kubectl exec … /bin/sh` or `kubectl run --command -- /bin/sh` fails with "no such file" when run from Git Bash on Windows.
- **Cause:** MSYS converts an argument starting with `/` into a Windows path (`C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/sh`).
- **Fix:** prefix the command with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`. Windows-native `kubectl` also can't read Git Bash `/tmp/...` paths; use a Windows path.

## The `mc` image is minimal

- **Symptom:** a script that works in a normal shell fails inside the MinIO client container.
- **Cause:** the `mc` image has no `awk` or `sed` (only shell built-ins plus `cut`, `tr`, `wc` and `date`), and `mc alias set` rejects a secret key shorter than 8 characters before contacting the server.
- **Fix:** write scripts for that image against those tools only, as the backup and restore scripts are.

## No JDK HTTP client will send a Host header that differs from the address

- **Symptom:** a test that reaches the preview proxy through a port-forward on `127.0.0.1` cannot make it route: the proxy picks the runner by `Host`, and the client either refuses to set the header or silently sends the address instead.
- **Cause:** `java.net.http.HttpClient` treats `Host` as restricted, and resolving `p12-abc.localhost` is left to the operating system, which does not treat `*.localhost` the same everywhere.
- **Fix:** write the request over a plain `Socket` (`PreviewPipelineIT.get`). It is twenty lines for a GET and depends on nothing.

## A page the proxy rewrites must not be cacheable

- **Symptom:** after a change to the script the preview proxy injects, a preview on a hostname the browser has seen before goes on behaving the old way - the address shows, back and forward stay grey, a typed address does nothing - while a fresh project works.
- **Cause:** the dev server sends its HTML with an ETag. The browser revalidates, the dev server answers "not modified", and the browser shows its cached copy, which carries whatever was injected into it when it was cached. A project keeps its preview hostname across restarts, so the cached copy outlives the proxy that made it.
- **Fix:** the proxy strips `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` from a page load and sends the rewritten page with no validator and `Cache-Control: no-store` (`proxy/index.js`). `PreviewPipelineIT` asks for the page with both headers and expects it whole. Anything that rewrites a response on the way out owns its caching too.
