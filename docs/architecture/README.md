# Architecture

How Singularity is put together: the services and what each one owns, how they talk to each other, how the important requests flow end to end, and the decisions behind the shape of it all.

If you are new to the codebase, read these in order:

1. [System context](system-context.md) — the services, their databases, and the external systems they depend on.
2. [Module map](module-map.md) — what lives in each module and package, and the layering rules inside a service.
3. [Service communication](service-communication.md) — the Gateway's route table and the internal service-to-service API.
4. The three request flows that cover almost everything non-trivial:
   - [Authentication](flows/authentication.md) — sign-in, sessions, and how every service trusts them.
   - [AI generation](flows/ai-generation.md) — a chat prompt becoming committed project files.
   - [Live preview](flows/live-preview.md) — a project running in its own Kubernetes pod.
