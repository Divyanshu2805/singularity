# File Revisions

Every change to a project's files — an AI turn, a file saved by hand or a restore — is published as one atomic, immutable **revision**. A revision either lands completely or not at all, and any earlier revision can be restored. The implementation lives in workspace-service: `RevisionPublisherImpl`, `RevisionManifestStore`, `RevisionServiceImpl` and `RevisionSnapshotReader`. The design rationale is in [ADR 0005](decisions/0005-content-addressed-file-revisions.md).

## Publishing a revision

1. **Stage.** Every changed path's new content is uploaded to a dedicated MinIO bucket (`project-blobs`, `minio.blob-bucket`) under `blob/<sha256>`. Blobs are content-addressed and immutable: the same bytes written twice, even across projects, land at the same key. A failure here leaves the live file layout and every table untouched, because nothing references the new content yet.
2. **Manifest.** One short Postgres transaction inserts a `PROJECT_FILE_REVISION` row in `STAGING` and one `PROJECT_FILE_REVISION_ENTRY` per changed path, recording both the new hash and the path's previous hash (the rollback data).
3. **Apply.** Each entry is copied server-side from its blob onto the project's live key (`{bucket}/{projectId}/{path}` — the layout every reader, including the preview pod's `mc mirror`, depends on), or removed for a delete. Any failure rolls back every entry already applied in that call using its previous hash, and marks the revision `FAILED`.
4. **Publish.** A single-statement compare-and-swap (`ProjectRepository.casAdvanceCurrentRevision`) advances `PROJECT.currentFileRevisionId` only if it still equals the revision this publish was staged against. Losing that race rolls back the same way and marks the revision `CONFLICT`.

The AI pipeline publishes one revision per turn through `POST /internal/v1/projects/{id}/revisions` ([internal API](../api/internal.md)).

## Restoring

Restore is not a special code path. `RevisionServiceImpl.restore` reconstructs the target revision's snapshot, diffs it against the project's current files, and publishes that diff through the same pipeline with `source = RESTORE`. Restores therefore always create a new, forward-only revision; history is never rewritten.

A snapshot at any revision is reconstructed by walking `parentRevisionId` back to the root and keeping each path's most recent entry (`ProjectFileRevisionRepository.reconstructSnapshot`, a recursive CTE).

**What a project held at a revision is more than that revision's snapshot.** The starter template's files, and the files a fork copied, are written with no revision, so a snapshot holds only the paths some revision has changed. `RevisionServiceImpl` therefore restores to the snapshot laid over each path's *original content* - the previous hash recorded by the first applied revision to touch that path (`ProjectFileRevisionRepository.findOriginalContent`) - and leaves alone any current file with no hash at all, which no revision has ever changed. Restoring from the snapshot alone would delete `package.json` and the whole component kit, and delete (rather than put back) a template file first changed after the restore point.

**Undo is a restore to just before a revision** (`before=true`): the same thing built from that revision's parent, and from the original content alone when the revision was the project's first. The chat offers it on every saved turn, which records its revision id for exactly this.

The restore endpoints are in the [revisions API](../api/revisions.md). They answer 404 unless the revision belongs to the project in the path and is `APPLIED`.

## Saving a file by hand

`FileEditServiceImpl` publishes one file's new text as a `MANUAL_EDIT` revision through the same pipeline (`PUT /api/projects/{id}/files/content`, [files API](../api/files.md)). It only saves a file that already exists, and only when the caller's `baseHash` is the hash of what the file holds now - a per-file check, so a build that changed other files does not refuse the save. Because it is a revision, a save by hand is in the history, can be undone, and brings a running preview level with it.

## Files created before revisions existed

A `ProjectFile` with `contentHash IS NULL` predates this pipeline. It is adopted lazily the first time it is next touched: its current bytes are read once, hashed, and staged as-is, becoming that write's `previousContentHash`. There is no bulk backfill — a Flyway migration cannot hash MinIO objects, and a file that is never touched again never needs history.

## Validation before publish

`RevisionValidator` is an extension point: `RevisionPublisherImpl` runs every bean of that type between the manifest commit and apply, and a rejection needs no rollback because nothing has touched the live layout yet.

`RevisionBuildValidator` is the built-in implementation. It:

1. claims a fresh, disposable runner pod — never a pod already serving a preview, since a concurrent build could starve or kill a live dev server;
2. uploads the staged revision's full snapshot into it (fabric8's tar-based upload, safe for binary content);
3. runs `npm install`, then a configurable check command — `npx tsc --noEmit` by default;
4. rejects the revision on a non-zero exit, with the tool's diagnostic output;
5. always deletes the pod afterwards. A pod that is never released is still swept by `PreviewReaper`'s label-based orphan sweep.

`tsc --noEmit` is the default rather than `npm run build` because the starter template's `build` script is a plain `vite build`, which strips TypeScript types without checking them.

It is **off by default** (`revision-validation.enabled: false`) because every run is a cold `npm install`, which adds real latency to every AI turn. If the warm pool has no idle pod, validation fails open. All settings live under `revision-validation.*` in workspace-service's `application.yaml`.

## Current limits

- **No blob garbage collection.** Blobs are never deleted, so storage grows monotonically. That is what keeps every revision restorable; reference counting can be added when real usage calls for it.
- **No crash recovery mid-apply.** An in-request failure rolls back cleanly, but a process crash between two apply steps leaves a revision stuck in `STAGING` with no automatic reconciliation.
- **A save by hand and a build do not lock each other.** The generation lock lives in intelligence-service; a save made while someone else's build is running lands, and the build - which read the files when it started - then publishes over it. The save is still in the history. The editor holds saving while the person's own response is being written.

These are tracked in [not yet built](../known-gaps/not-yet-built.md).
