# Architecture Decisions

Short records of the decisions that shape Singularity, each with the context that forced it and the trade-offs it accepts. They explain *why* the system looks the way it does; the rest of the architecture docs explain *what* it is.

## Writing a new record

Add a file named `NNNN-short-title.md` with the next number, using the same sections as the existing records: **Status**, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**. Once a record is accepted, don't rewrite it; if a decision changes, add a new record that supersedes it and update the old one's status.
