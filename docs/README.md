# Singularity Documentation

Everything about how Singularity is built, run and changed. Start with the section that matches what you're trying to do.

## Getting started

- [Local development](local-development/README.md) — prerequisites, configuration, running the stack, live previews, troubleshooting.
- [Tech stack](tech-stack.md) — the languages, frameworks and services in use.

## Understanding the system

- [Architecture](architecture/README.md) — services, module map, request flows, security model, file revisions.
- [Architecture decisions](architecture/decisions/README.md) — why the system is shaped the way it is.
- [Data model](schema/README.md) — the three databases, their entities, and schema conventions.

## Reference

- [API reference](api/README.md) — every endpoint, the streaming formats, and the error model.
- [Known gaps](known-gaps/README.md) — constraints, trade-offs, and what isn't built yet.

## Contributing

- [Engineering practices](practices/README.md) — conventions, security guardrails, testing, definition of done, and known pitfalls.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) — the contribution workflow.

## Running in production

- [Deployment](deployment/README.md) — infrastructure, manifests, images, CI/CD, configuration, provisioning, capacity.
- [Operations](operations/README.md) — deploys and rollback, monitoring, backups, upkeep.

## Keeping these docs accurate

These pages describe the system as it is now. A change that makes any of them inaccurate updates them in the same pull request.
