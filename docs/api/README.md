# API Reference

The contract for Singularity's REST API. There is no generated OpenAPI spec, so these pages are the reference: when an endpoint's shape changes, update its page in the same change.

## Base URL and routing

All browser traffic goes to the Gateway — `http://localhost:8000` locally, the app's own origin in production. In development the Vite dev server proxies `/api` there, so the frontend always calls same-origin relative paths. The Gateway forwards each path, unmodified, to the service that owns it:

| Path prefix | Owning service |
|---|---|
| `/api/auth/**`, `/api/plans`, `/api/me/**`, `/api/payments/**`, `/webhooks/payment` | account-service |
| `/api/projects/**` (except `.../code/**`), `/api/previews` | workspace-service |
| `/api/chat/**`, `/api/ideas/**`, `/api/usage/**`, `/api/projects/{id}/code/**` | intelligence-service |
| `/internal/**` | Never routed — service-to-service only |

A path no route owns is a 404 from the Gateway. `RoutingTableTest` pins every documented path to its owner.

## Conventions

**Authentication.** Requests are authenticated by an `httpOnly` session cookie (`__Host-vc_session`) issued after a Firebase sign-in. Every endpoint requires it except `GET /api/auth/csrf`, `POST /api/auth/session`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/plans` and `POST /webhooks/payment`. See [Authentication](authentication.md).

**CSRF.** Every state-changing request (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) must send the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header, echoing the `__Host-XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. Call `GET /api/auth/csrf` once on load to obtain it.

**Request size.** The Gateway refuses a body over 1 MB with `413` before any service sees it. Individual fields have their own, smaller limits, stated on each endpoint.

**Authorization.** Project-scoped endpoints check the caller's role on that project. The tables on each page state the minimum role (`VIEWER`, `EDITOR`, `OWNER`) or permission (`VIEW`, `EDIT`).

**Request bodies** are JSON and validated; a validation failure is a `400` listing every invalid field. See [Request validation](validation.md).

**Errors** share one JSON shape from every service. Branch on `status` and on the presence of `quota` (402) or `code` (503), never on message text. See [Errors](errors.md).

**Quotas.** A request that would exceed the caller's plan returns `402` before any expensive work starts, with a `quota` object describing the limit.

**Streaming** endpoints use server-sent events. There are two different payload formats; see [Streaming](streaming.md).
