# Code Insight

Explanations of selected code, questions about a project, and each user's saved notes. **Service:** intelligence-service · **Controller:** `CodeInsightController` (`/api/projects/{projectId}/code`)

These paths sit under `/api/projects/**` but are routed to intelligence-service, not workspace-service: the Gateway gives `/api/projects/*/code/**` a higher priority. Every endpoint requires project `VIEW`.

**Read-only by construction.** The model is given at most one tool (`read_files`) and its prompts never mention the file-writing protocol, so nothing on this path can edit a project. See [AI prompt boundaries](../architecture/security-model.md#ai-prompt-boundaries).

| Method | Path | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/code/explain` | `ExplainCodeRequest { path, code, startLine, endLine }` | `{ answer }` | One-shot explanation of a selected block. `402` if the daily token budget is spent. |
| `POST` | `/code/ask` | `AskCodeRequest { path?, code?, question, history }` | `{ answer }` | The selection is optional — omit it to ask about the project in general. The project's file paths (not contents) are always sent as context. `history` is replayed by the client (at most 40 turns); each turn's `role` is validated by value, and anything other than `"assistant"` is treated as a user message. Same budget check. |
| `POST` | `/code/explain/stream` | as `/code/explain` | SSE, plain text | The endpoint the UI uses. |
| `POST` | `/code/ask/stream` | as `/code/ask` | SSE, plain text | The endpoint the UI uses. |
| `POST` | `/code/lesson/stream` | `LessonRequest { eventId }` - the id of a `FILE_EDIT` event in the caller's own chat on this project | SSE, plain text | Teaching mode's lesson on what one step of a saved turn changed, asked for when the person opens the step. Nothing but the id comes from the browser: the server reads the file as the turn saved it and the version it replaced from the event, and gives the model only the changed lines (new-file line numbers, a few lines of context; the whole file when the step created it), with what the person asked for and the turn's steps. The model gets no tool and answers with an opening, one `### L12-18 · Title` section per piece of the change, and a closing `### What happens next`. `404` if the event is not a file edit in the caller's own conversation on this project; `400` if its turn was not built in teaching mode. The finished lesson is stored on the event and returned as-is on every later call - no model call, no budget check - and is included in the chat history as the event's `lesson`. A stream that fails or is abandoned stores nothing. The call asks for low reasoning effort: a first real call at the default took 17 s to its first word and 24 s in all, and 4 s and 11 s at low. Same budget check as the others when a lesson has to be written. |
| `GET` | `/code/notes` | — | `CodeNoteResponse[]` | The caller's own saved notes for this project, oldest first. |
| `POST` | `/code/notes` | `SaveCodeNoteRequest { question, answer, selection? }` | `CodeNoteResponse` | Saves one finished exchange. The client calls this after a stream finishes. |
| `DELETE` | `/code/notes/{noteId}` | — | `204` | Another member's note id is a `404`, not a `403` — the lookup is scoped to the caller, so it simply isn't found. |
| `DELETE` | `/code/notes` | — | `204` | Clears the caller's notes for this project. |

Notes are private: every query filters on both the project and the caller, so members of the same project never see each other's notes.
