# Deployment

How Singularity runs in production: a single free-tier Arm VM running single-node k3s, behind a Cloudflare tunnel, deployed by GitHub Actions. The design rationale is in [ADR 0007](../architecture/decisions/0007-single-node-k3s-deployment.md); day-to-day running is covered in [Operations](../operations/README.md).

**Key properties**

- **No open inbound ports.** Web traffic arrives through the Cloudflare tunnel; deploys and administration arrive over Tailscale.
- **Continuous deployment** with tests, a smoke test and automatic rollback. No secret lives on the server: every Kubernetes Secret is rebuilt from a GitHub environment on each deploy.
- **Portable.** Nothing depends on Oracle. The same Kustomize manifests run on a local kind cluster, so moving hosts is a settings change plus a restore.
- **About $0 a month**, plus a domain and a capped AI key.
