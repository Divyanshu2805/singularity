/**
 * What every test file gets before it runs.
 *
 * Handles: the DOM matchers, a stub for the media-query API jsdom does not implement, a no-op resize observer, and a
 * canvas that has no drawing context - jsdom has none, and without the stub every page standing on the app's sky
 * (LandingBackdrop's starfield) logged a not-implemented error; the starfield already draws nothing without one.
 *
 * The resize observer matters: anything rendering the sliding overflow text - the sidebar's project names, the chat
 * rail's labels - observes its own width with one, and without a stub those components cannot mount. Treating "never
 * measured" as "text fits" is the right default when there is no layout anyway.
