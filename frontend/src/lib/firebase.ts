/**
 * The Firebase app and Auth instance, created on first use.
 *
 * Handles: the web config - none of it secret, since it only identifies the project and access is governed by
 * authorized domains and the backend's token checks - the Google provider, and turning a Firebase error code into a
 * readable sentence.
 *
 * An unrecognised code is appended to the fallback rather than dropped, so a cause this switch does not name yet is
 * still diagnosable from the UI. The code is only read when it is actually a string: an ApiRequestError declares a
 * code property that is usually undefined, and treating that as present once made every backend failure during the
 * sign-in exchange - a spent quota, an unverified email, a stale sign-in - read as the generic provider error.
 *
 * Persistence is in-memory on purpose: Firebase's default keeps a refresh token in browser storage, where any script
 * on the page could read it. This app's own session is an httpOnly cookie instead, so the Firebase user is needed
 * only long enough to mint it.
 *
 * A build can be pointed at the Firebase Auth emulator with VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_URL, which is how the
 * browser journey test signs in without a real Firebase project (e2e/). The address is used only when it is this
 * machine's own - localhost or a loopback address - so no build can send sign-ins to another host by this route,
 * whatever the variable says. Nothing that deploys sets it.
