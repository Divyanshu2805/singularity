 * back by itself, the key that remembers an auto-start, detecting a dependency change that needs a restart rather
 * than a reload, the preview's own origin for message checks, turning a failure into words with a cause, and
 * formatting the idle countdown.
 *
 * The step names must match what the server writes, since the checklist ticks by matching them. Auto-start is
 * deliberately narrow: only this person's own preview that ended without them choosing it, never one a collaborator
