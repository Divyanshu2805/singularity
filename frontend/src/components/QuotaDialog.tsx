/**
 * What a spent allowance looks like to the person who hit it.
 *
 * Handles: saying which limit was reached, showing the numbers off the error itself rather than parsing its sentence,
 * and offering the upgrade.
 *
 * Deliberately a dialog offering an upgrade rather than a red error toast: nothing went wrong and the request was
 * perfectly valid - they have simply reached the edge of what they are paying for, and treating that as a failure is
 * both inaccurate and the worst possible framing at the moment someone is most likely to consider paying.
