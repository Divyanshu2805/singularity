 *
 * Handles: building the policy from the origins this deployment actually uses - the API, the identity provider's
 * domain, and any origins live previews are framed from.
 *
 * With the session in an httpOnly cookie such a script still cannot steal it, and this stops it loading its payload
 * or sending data anywhere this list does not name. Injected as a meta tag at build time only: the dev server relies
 * on inline scripts and a websocket that a real policy would block. A meta policy cannot set frame-ancestors, so when
 * deployed, serve this same policy as a response header and add that directive there.
